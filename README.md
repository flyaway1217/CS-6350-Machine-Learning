# Decision Tree

This decision tree implementation is based on the ID3 algorithm.

This tree is without any pruning, only have a parameter to limit the depth of the tree.

# Perceptron

This perceptron is implemented based on the 3 different perceptron algorithm:

1. Standard Perceptron
2. Margin Perceptron
3. Aggressive Perceptron

This implementation also include a simple ``draw.py`` script which is used to draw figures of different parameters.

# TODO

1. Visualize the decision tree in the browser.
